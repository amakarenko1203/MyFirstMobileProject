PLACEHOLDER APK FILE

This is a placeholder file. Replace this with your actual Android APK file.

To get a real APK:
1. Build your Android app using Android Studio or Gradle
2. Download an APK from your app's release or build artifacts
3. Place the actual APK file here: tests/app.apk

For testing purposes, you can also use demo APKs:
- ApiDemos-debug.apk from Android SDK samples
- Any open-source Android app APK

Make sure the APK is compatible with your target Android device/emulator.
